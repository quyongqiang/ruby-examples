# rvm errors
Warning! PATH is not properly set up, '/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/bin' is not at first place,
         usually this is caused by shell initialization files - check them for 'PATH=...' entries,
         it might also help to re-add RVM to your dotfiles: 'rvm get stable --auto-dotfiles',
         to fix temporarily in this shell session run: 'rvm use ruby-2.2.1'.
Unknown ruby interpreter version (do not know how to handle): 0-v.
# solve , add following line into ~/.bash_profile.
# export PATH="/usr/local/rvm/gems/ruby-2.2.1/bin:$PATH"
